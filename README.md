### XOR Logic with a Neural Network on a Raspberry Pi Pico

Files that will be add to this repository between 1-7 March 2025:
1) XOR_NN_RaspPiPico_Vx.pdf (Project documentation)
2) main.py (MicroPython file for Raspberry Pi Pico)
3) XOR_nn.ipynb  (same as 2 but modified for interactive input and plotting)
4) AND_perceptron.ipynb  
5) *.uf2 file for MicroPython with ulab



Notes:

a) *uf2 file from:
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html


b) *.ipynb files are Jupyter Notebook files
